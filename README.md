# AlienInvasion
"In the game "Alien Invasion", the player control a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.
The player can move ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.
When the game begins, a leet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen.
The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new sleet appears that moves faster
than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen,
the player looses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends."
